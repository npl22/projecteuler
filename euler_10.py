"""Project Euler 10 Solution.

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

Hint 1: Any number n can have only one primefactor greater than sqrt(n).
You have a number 'NÂ²'. If it has a factor J < N, then the other factor has to
be greater than N. Hence, when you check that J is a factor of N, effectively
you check the other factor also.

Hint 2: Use the Sieve of Eratothenes method.
Start from the first prime number 2, iteratively mark the multiples of each
prime number as composite (not prime). For example, note 2 and 3 as prime and
remove all of their multiples up to n. The next number to be checked would be
5 since 4 is a multiple of 2 and was removed. This is much faster than using
modular division to check.
