"""Project Euler 4 Solution.

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Notes for learning:
#[::-1] reverses a string using slicing,
#[:] makes a copy of the string :-1 -> :step number
#Thus, [::-1] is a copy of the string but in steps of -1
